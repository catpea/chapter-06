Welcome to the audiobook bug-fixing project! We are dedicated to providing an excellent listening experience for our users. Our goal is to make sure that all the content is error-free and of the highest quality.

This open source project provides an opportunity for you to help us improve the mighty audiobook experience. As a listener, you can use your knowledge and expertise to examine the audio and identify any issues that might be preventing the audiobook from reaching highest quality. Once identified, you can submit bug-fixes to ensure that the audiobook will be enjoyable for all.

We appreciate your help in making the audiobook experience better for all the listeners. Thank you for joining this project and helping us make the open school experience a great one!
